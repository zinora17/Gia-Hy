## Assignment 2: Reflective blog

At the beginning of the class, Mr.Jonathan introduced programs related to computers and technology. Those programs include IT, Microsoft Engineering, Aeronautics, Psychology, Electrical and electronics, robotics and mechatronics, food technology, and science. After briefly talking about those programs, Mr.Jonathan began to clearly analyze each program. The most obvious program that Mr.Jonathan explained was IT and Microsoft Engineering because most of the students in this class chose that program. After recess, the teacher continued to explain the credits for each program and the GPA that are so important and new to students in this grade. At the end of the class, the teacher talked about the Assignment, especially our first exercise which was to create a reflective blog to familiarize yourself with the computer technology environment. After the class, me and my friends have a lot of questions to ask the teacher such as what is the score to pass this course, is this course harder when comparing to the last course and are students allow to choose teammate in grou assignment.
About the feeling, I'm half nervous, and half excited because I don't have in-depth knowledge about the program I'm about to study and the knowledge I'll absorb in the first session of this course. During the class, Mr.Jonathan's explanation of computer and technology related programs opened my mind. The most useful information for me was about the IT program because I am about to study it. At the end of the week, I struggled and worried a lot about the first assignment because I have almost no knowledge of codes and I also missed a class on Monday. But luckily in the next class, Mr.Jonathan agreed to delay the assignment for one week.
One of the most difference between this course and the last course is there is a fewer activities during the class. In the last course student do activities every time the teacher finished teaching small part, we also called it as learning by doing strategy. But in this course is more about listening to the teacher and then take note and then apply the lesson to  assignments. Another difference between this course and last course is students studies in computer room, we use computer during the class a lot, especially for the first assignment that students are strungling. About Mr.Jonathan, his England ancent is new to me so it is quite hard for me to hear and understand what he is talking about. But in return Mr.Jonathan is very considerate, he comes to a single student in class to check and solve the problems that student are strugling. The clearest evidence is when he come to me and explain what steps should I do to finish the first assignemt, I asked him to reexplain many times because his ancent was quite hard to hear for me and Mr.Jonathan still happy to try help understand what he is talking about.
